			<h1>I never thought I’d like coding, but then...</h1>
			<p>
				I never thought I’d like coding, but then I actually took classes on it. When I first started coding I did not think I would like it but when I found out easy and fun it could be. It also helped that I was able to pick up on how to right code by looking at examples. Knowing how to code did not make me like coding though knowing what endless possibilities just simple code could bring got me excited. When I was assigned to do something in class I found my self finishing what needed to be done and then often playing with a similar code to figure out what else I could do with it. Some how when coding things I wanted coding was fun even though I never would have thought it could be. I really enjoyed typing things out in code then running the code and seeing what I had written come to life; I was amazed with how easy it could be to wright a simple yet fun game.
